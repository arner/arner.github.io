Since last weekend my floor is cleaned by [GLaDOS](https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/GLaDOS), the artificial intelligence who supervises the Aperture Science testing facilities in the Portal games.

Watch this video to get an idea of her delightful personality. Buy the games on Steam if you haven't played them yet, they're awesome!

In this series of blog posts I'll document how I got her to perform the simple task of cleaning my floor - albeit somewhat reluctantly.

If you want to follow along, all you need is Xiaomi or Roborock vacuum cleaner, a bit of comfort using the command line and the appetite to play around. Mine is a first generation Xiaomi, but it should work on other generations as well (see if it's featured on the pictures [here](https://builder.dontvacuum.me/)).

This is what you'll end up with. As you can see, she's still alive and we're getting along just fine.

Here's what we'll do:

1. [Root your Xiaomi or Roborock vacuum](/posts/#root-your-xiaomi-vacuum) (it has other benefits as well).
1. [Install the GLaDOS voice pack](/posts/#install-the-glados-voice-pack)
1. [Make it play a sound when it bumps into something](/posts/#install-the-oucher).

Have fun!
